# Dominant Color Detection in Images using K-Means Clustering

This project allows users to **analyze and visualize the dominant colors** in an image using **K-Means clustering**. The script extracts the top colors, visualizes their percentages, shows their histograms, and overlays them on the original image with proper color names and hex codes.

---

## Why did I make this project??

Colors carry **semantic and psychological meaning**, influence **human perception**, and are often the first features noticed in images. Automatically detecting dominant colors has applications in:

- **Image indexing and retrieval**
- **Digital art and design tools**
- **E-commerce product color classification**
- **Interior design & fashion tech**
- **AI aesthetics analysis**
  
This project combines **unsupervised machine learning (K-Means clustering)** with **image processing** to quantify and visualize the color composition of an image.

## Scientific Background

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an **unsupervised machine learning algorithm** that partitions data into `k` clusters based on similarity.

#### Mathematically:
- Given: data points \( X = \{x_1, x_2, ..., x_n\} \)
- Objective: Minimize the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)

\[
\text{WCSS} = \sum_{i=1}^{k} \sum_{x \in C_i} \|x - \mu_i\|^2
\]

Where \( \mu_i \) is the mean of cluster \( C_i \).

In our case, each pixel \( x_i = [B, G, R] \) is treated as a point in 3D color space.

### Color Naming via Webcolors

After clustering, each centroid (dominant color) is matched to a **closest named color** using the `webcolors` library. If a name is not found (i.e., not in CSS3 color set), it is labeled as **Unknown**.

---

### ðŸ“Š Histogram Visualization

We compute histograms for the matched pixels per color cluster using OpenCV's `cv2.calcHist`. This shows the **intensity distribution** of each dominant color.

## How It Works

```python
flat_img = np.reshape(img, (-1, 3))
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
kmeans.fit(flat_img)
